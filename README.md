# Viral_Genomics
In efforts to analyze genomic similarities in viral genomes from industrial, non-industrial, and pre-modern fecal samples, we made connections through shared protein clusters using the vcontact2 pipeline. 

### Network Colored by Time Period
- grey = database
- red = industrial
- blue = pre-industrial
- green = paleo

### Network Colored by Lifestyle
- grey = database
- purple = lytic
- orange = temperate
